## How to use

- Ensure Kotlin 1.4.20 and Scala 2.13.3 plugins are installed and ready to use in IntelliJ
- Load project in IntelliJ
	- when importing the project for the first time, it might take a while for IntelliJ to download all the dependencies. Wait until all background processes have been completed
- Optional: to start with some sample projects, rename `sample-data.json` to `data.json`
- Run the main method in `src/main/java/Main.java`
